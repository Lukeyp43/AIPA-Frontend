## What is AIPA? 

AIPA (Artificial Intelligence Physician Assistant) is a voice-activated interface that allows easy data collection from physician patients. 

* Visually appealing UI.
* Automatically sends reports to doctor on duty

## Why AIPA?

According to the AAPA[1], the US could face a shortage of up to 100k physicians by 2030. To keep up with the demand of patients in America, we created AIPA. AIPA leverages speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology to streamline medical appointments, saving time for both physicians and patients
